# AWS Lambda Twilio Signal Talk
This short demo shows how you can use the power of AWS Lambda to perform complex tasks based on events. Imagine you have a motion activated camera that uploads a picture to an S3 bucket. Rather than having queues, stateful servers, and other maintenance prone activities just imagine having a function. A function that runs in the cloud whenever you upload a new picture. It checks to see if that picture contains a face and will shoot you an MMS if it does.

## Setup
There are a few simple steps to get setup.

### S3 Buckets

### AWS Lambda Function

#### OpenCV Library Compilation
You can compile the library on any AWS Amazon Linux instance by following the instructions below or you can download the statically compiled library here:
